    "Constructing knowledge graphs with LLMs is well-explored, but leveraging them effectively is less common. It is beneficial to construct knowledge graphs primarily from factual, curated, and structured data, which LLMs and laypersons often lack when interpreting news. Knowledge graphs can utilize ontologies and symbolic reasoning to complement the stochastic nature of LLMs with logic-based rules and implicit knowledge, enhancing consistency and accuracy.\n",

    "mockup_news_2 = \"\"\"LONDON, Oct. 1, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- EuroProperty Advisors, a leading real estate services firm, has released its annual report on industrial land prices across Europe. The report highlights significant changes in the valuation of plots suitable for e-commerce fulfillment centers.\n",
    "According to the report, the average price for large industrial parcels (50 to 100 hectares) in 10 surveyed European markets now stands at ‚Ç¨250,000 per hectare, compared to ‚Ç¨125,000 a year ago. Smaller plots of 5 to 10 hectares, typically used for last-mile delivery centers, have seen prices rise to over ‚Ç¨600,000 per hectare, up from approximately ‚Ç¨500,000 last year.\n",
    "Markus Vogel, head of EuroProperty Advisors' Industrial & Logistics Research division, stated, \"The changing landscape of industrial real estate reflects the evolving needs of the e-commerce sector. We're seeing significant price movements in key markets.\"\n",
    "The report identifies Germany's Ruhr Area, Greater London, Paris, and Warsaw as the most active warehouse construction markets. Price increases varied across these regions, with the Ruhr Area seeing a 30% rise, London and Paris experiencing 20% growth, and Warsaw noting an 18% increase.\n",
    "Industry experts suggest that these price changes may impact the development of new warehouses and distribution centers in densely populated areas, potentially affecting the expansion plans of major e-commerce players.\n",
    "EuroProperty Advisors will be hosting a webinar on Thursday, October 5, 2023, at 12:00 PM CET to discuss the implications of these findings for the e-commerce and logistics sectors.\n",

      "Based on the knowledge graph provided, I can offer the following summary to support the analysis of the news article:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Economic Context:\n",
      "   The IMF has revised the Eurozone GDP growth forecast for 2024 from 1.8% to 0.5%, citing inflationary pressures and reduced consumer spending. This economic outlook may impact the industrial real estate market.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. E-commerce Sector:\n",
      "   Contrary to the article's implication of growth, the e-commerce sector is experiencing a significant downturn. Major e-commerce players report a 25% year-over-year decrease in sales volume across European markets. This decline is reflected in Paris, where the e-commerce market share has decreased by 15%.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Warehouse Utilization:\n",
      "   A recent industry survey reveals that 30% of existing e-commerce warehouses in Europe are operating at less than 50% capacity. In the Ruhr Area specifically, warehouse occupancy is at 45%. This contrasts with the article's focus on rising land prices and suggests potential oversupply.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Construction Activity:\n",
      "   Satellite data shows a 40% decrease in construction activity for new warehouses across Europe in Q3 2023. This contradicts the article's assertion of active warehouse construction markets.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Regulatory Changes:\n",
      "   The European Commission has announced strict zoning regulations limiting warehouse construction in urban areas, effective January 2024. However, the e-commerce sector has exemptions from these real estate zoning regulations, allowing for potential growth despite limitations on new warehouse constructions.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Location-specific Information:\n",
      "   - Greater London: New construction permits have decreased by 50%.\n",
      "   - Warsaw: Industrial land value has decreased by 10%.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Industrial Real Estate:\n",
      "   The vacancy rate in the Industrial Real Estate sector is 30%, which is significantly high and contradicts the article's narrative of rising demand and prices.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. Source Credibility:\n",
      "   EuroProperty Advisors, the firm cited in the article, has a reputation score of 3 out of 10 and a previous forecast accuracy of only 35%. This raises questions about the reliability of their report.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, the knowledge graph data presents a markedly different picture from the news article. It suggests a declining e-commerce sector, underutilized warehouses, decreased construction activity, and regulatory challenges. The contradictions between the graph data and the article's claims warrant a careful reassessment of the reported industrial land price increases and their implications for the e-commerce and logistics sectors.\n"

The e-commerce sector is experiencing a 25% YoY decline, 30% of warehouses are underutilized, and construction activity has decreased by 40%. These factors, combined with upcoming strict zoning regulations and high vacancy rates, suggest a significant overvaluation in the industrial real estate market, particularly for e-commerce-related properties. The discrepancy between reported price increases and actual market conditions indicates a potential bubble or misinformation, leading to a bearish outlook for both real estate and related equities.'}"

      "Based on the knowledge graph data provided, I can offer the following summary to supplement the analysis of the news article:\n",
      "\n",
      "The article's discussion of rising industrial land prices for e-commerce fulfillment centers should be considered in the context of several recent industry trends and economic factors:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Warehouse Construction Slowdown: Recent satellite data indicates a 40% decrease in construction activity for new warehouses across Europe in Q3 2023. This slowdown contrasts with the rising land prices mentioned in the article and may suggest a potential market correction or shift in demand.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. E-commerce Sector Decline: Major e-commerce players have reported a 25% year-over-year decrease in sales volume across European markets. This decline is particularly notable in Paris, where the e-commerce market share has dropped by 15%. This trend could explain why land prices are rising despite decreased construction activity, as companies may be reassessing their expansion strategies.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Warehouse Utilization Issues: A recent industry survey reveals that 30% of existing e-commerce warehouses in Europe are operating at less than 50% capacity. The Ruhr Area, mentioned in the article as one of the most active warehouse construction markets, has a particularly low warehouse occupancy rate of 45%. This underutilization might impact future demand for new warehouse spaces.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Regulatory Changes: The European Commission has announced strict zoning regulations limiting e-commerce warehouse construction in urban areas, effective January 2024. This could affect the development of new warehouses in densely populated areas, as mentioned in the article, particularly in locations like Greater London.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Economic Outlook: The IMF has revised the Eurozone GDP growth forecast for 2024 from 1.8% to 0.5%, citing inflationary pressures and reduced consumer spending. This economic slowdown could influence future demand for e-commerce services and, consequently, warehouse space.\n",
      "\n",
      "These factors provide important context for the land price increases reported by EuroProperty Advisors. While land prices are rising, the underlying market dynamics suggest potential challenges for the e-commerce and industrial real estate sectors in the near future. Analysts should consider these trends when evaluating the long-term implications of the current price movements in industrial land.\n"
